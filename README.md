# Labyrinth_Pacman
A re-imagined mini-project version of the classic "Pac-man". The player moves through a procedurally generated labyrinth in search of powerups while trying to avoid enemy AI and survive for as long as possible. The labyrinth is generated based on the BSP-algorithm with slight modification. The enemy AI uses a small variety of pathfinding algorithms, including but not limited to A* &amp; Drunken Walk.
